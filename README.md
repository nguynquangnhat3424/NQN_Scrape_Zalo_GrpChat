# NQN_Scrape_Zalo_GrpChat
**Objective:** To compile a summary of investment opinions from various brokers through Zalo chat rooms.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Utilize code to scrape message content from 12 Zalo chat rooms belonging to different brokers.
2. Use prompts to request AI (Google's NotebookLM) to summarize the scraped message content.
3. Implement code to organize the AI-generated summary into a structured table categorized by labels: "Positive," "Negative," and "Neutral," while filtering for frequently mentioned stock codes across the chat rooms.

**Note:** To follow this project, please adjust the local file paths and Zalo group IDs as per your requirements.
